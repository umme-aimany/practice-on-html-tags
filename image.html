                    modern for that era. In fact, some historians believe Moen Jo Daro was probably the most advanced
                    society of its time. Moen Jo Daro is a phrase of Sindhi language, which means ‘Mound of the dead’.
                    It is an entire city that remained buried underneath the sand for centuries."

                Our next historical destination is Ranikot Fort that takes us all the way to Jamshoro District. It is a
                very large fort having huge walls running around it. This place is almost thirty kilometres southwest of
                Sann, which is a small town and one of the most fascinating historical places to visit in Sindh. Ranikot
                Fort is often dubbed as the ‘Great Wall of Sindh’ as the total circumference of its wall is over 30
                kilometres. It is still unknown why this fort was built in the first place, but it was reconstructed
                multiple times in different historical eras. However, archeologists believe that the present day
                structure of Ranikot Fort was reconstructed by the Talpurs in the 1700s after spending over a million
                rupees.

                One of the most interesting funerary sites in the world is found around 30 kilometres east of Karachi.
                Spread over a large plane, Chaukhandi Necropolis is one of the most incredible historical places in
                Sindh having over dozens of tombs and graves built over almost three centuries. It is known as the
                family graveyard belonging to the Jokhio tribe who originally came from the region of Rajasthan in
                India. The architecture of every tomb erected in this age-old graveyard is extremely unique and each of
                them has skillfully carved designs on it that reflect the mastery of the artisans of the old times. Some
                tombs in Chaukhandi Necropolis contain single graves while others contain multiple, having as much as
                eight burial chambers in each of them.

                The architecture style followed by Mughals during their reign in South Asia has always left the world
                spellbound. Speaking of Mughal architecture, it is obvious to mention the name of Shah Jahan Mosque. To
                visit this fascinating historical site, one has to make a trip to the city of Thatta. Shah Jahan Mosque,
                also known as Jamia Masjid of Thatta, was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a gift to the local
                people for their hospitality. It is a beautifully constructed structure with elegant carvings and
                stunning design. The geometrical details of the architecture of the mosque are incredibly enchanting,
                making everyone feel captivated by its magical beauty.
